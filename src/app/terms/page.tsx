            Welcome to Xessex (&quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; or &quot;our&quot;).

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">1. Adult-Only Platform</h2>
          <p>
            Xessex is strictly for adults. By accessing this Platform, you confirm that:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-3 space-y-2">

            <li>You have the legal capacity to agree to these Terms</li>
            <li>You are accessing the Platform from a location where adult content is lawful</li>
            <li>You will not allow any minor to access or view this Platform</li>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">2. RTA (Restricted to Adults) Compliance</h2>
          <p>
            Xessex is fully RTA (Restricted to Adults) compliant and maintains active RTA verification, including RTA tags and logos displayed across all pages of the Platform.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">
            This allows parental control software, ISPs, browsers, operating systems, and device-level filters to automatically block Xessex when adult filtering is enabled.

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">3. Parental Responsibility</h2>
          <p>
            We are committed to protecting minors. However, parents and guardians are responsible for monitoring and controlling their children&apos;s internet access.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">We strongly encourage the use of:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
            <li>Device-level parental controls (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android)</li>
            <li>ISP filtering services</li>
            <li>Third-party parental control software</li>
          </ul>
